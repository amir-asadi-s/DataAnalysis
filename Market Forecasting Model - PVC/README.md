# PVC Demand and Forecast Analysis

This project uses **Power BI** for data visualization and **Python** (with Prophet) for forecasting PVC demand trends. The analysis includes historical data from 2005-2024 and forecasted demand for future years, with separate models for each region. The goal is to provide insights and facilitate decision-making based on trends in PVC production, demand, imports, exports, and capacity.
